# Strategy
My coding strategy was to try and make the aquarium look alive, I did this by making the fish swim back and forth while also rotating slightly and bobbing up and down slightly. I did this by manipulating the y, x scale and x position of the fish sprite. I think I did a good job but I would have liked to have the fish be more dynamic by randomly idling and not swimming all the way to the edges every time but I just ran out of time to implement it.
